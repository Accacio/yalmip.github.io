In this example, we will combine methods for expressing [if-statements](/) with built-in support for [integrating polynomial functions symbolically](/command/int).

## Integrals of piecewise affine functions

Our goal here is to optimize models involving integrals of the form \\(\int_0^x f(z)\dz \\) where \\(x\\) is a decision variable and \\(f\\) is a piecewise affine function. Since an integral of a affine function is quadratic, this means we are going to be faced with optimization of piecewise quadratic functions.

Let us construct a simple example where our goal is to maximize an integrated piecewise affine function where

$$
f(z) = \begin{cases} 2z , & \text{for } 0\geq z \leq 2\\
                     4  , & \text{for } 2 \leq z\leq 4\\
                     16-3z , & \text{for } 4 \leq z 
                     \end{cases}
$$

An alternative representation is \\(\min(\min(4,2z),16-3z)\\). To see what we are working with, we plot it and its numerically computed integral.

````matlab
t = 0:0.001:8;
f = min(min(2*t,4),16-3*t);
l = plot(t,f);
grid on;hold on
l = plot(t,0.001*cumsum(f))

Due to the negative slope in the third region, the piecewise quadratic function is non-convex.

### The hard way

As a first approach, we do it the hard way by first oing pen and paper computations to explicitly compute the integral to obtain our piecewise quadratic function

$$
\int_{0}^x f(z) = \begin{cases} x^2 , & \text{for } 0\geq z \leq 2\\
                     (2)^2 + (4x-8), & \text{for } 2 \leq z\leq 4\\
                     (2^2)+(4\cdot 4 - 8) + (16x-\frac{3}{2}x^2)-(16\cdot 4-\frac{3}{2}4^2) , & \text{for } 4 \leq z 
                     \end{cases}
$$

Having these expression, we are ready to implement the model. What we have to do is to represent that the objective is defined differently in different regions, which effectively means we have to implement [if-else statements](/modellingif). Proceeding exactly as we learn there, we end up with our finished product.

````matlab
sdpvar x
sdpvar f
region = binvar(3,1);

R1 = [0 <= x <= 2];
R2 = [2 <= x <= 4];
R3 = [0 <= x];
Model = [implies(region(1), [R1, f == x^2])
         implies(region(2), [R2, f == -4 + 4*x])
         implies(region(3), [R3, f == -28 + 16*x - 1.5*x^2])
         sum(region) == 1
         [0 <= x <= 10]];

optimize(Model, -f)
````

Important to realize is that this model is hard from two different aspects. To begin with, we have binary variables as we have to represent the disjunctive nature, but we also have quadratic equalities inside these disjunctions. Hence, the final product is a mixed-integer nonlinear non-convex quadratically constraint problem.

### The harder but hopefully better way

As we learn in [if-else statements](/modellingif), models where a piecewise quadratic function is used in the objective can be improved upon by slightly by removing the quadratic equalities from the equalitities and lift them into the objective. The trick to do so is to assign a local copy of the decision variable to each region. Using this strategy here leads to

````matlab
sdpvar x1 x2 x3
Model = [implies(region(1), [R1, x1 == x, x2 == 0, x3 == 0])
         implies(region(2), [R2, x2 == x, x1 == 0, x3 == 0])
         implies(region(3), [R3, x3 == x, x1 == 0, x2 == 0])
         sum(region) == 1
         [0 <= x <= 10]];
f = x1^2 + (-4*region(2)+4*x2) + (-28+16*x3 - 1.5*x3^2);
optimize(Model, -f)
````

Had the piecewise affine functions been non-increasing, the quadratic function would have been concave, and the resulting model here would have had a convex objective, i.e. we would have had a convex MIQP which typically is easier to handle as branching only has to be performed in the combinatorial space, and not in the continuous space. There are more solvers available for this model class too.

### Getting lazy

The reaon we use YALMIP is because we are lazy, so the models above are too much manual labour. Our goal is to do all the integration related manipulations automatically.

First, note that the integral is \\(\int_0^x f(z)\dz  = \int_0^u_1 f_1(z)\dz + \int_u_1รป_2 f_2(z)\dz + \ldots\\). 

Now we sum up these functions and we have our piecewise quadratic functions in the three regions. 

````matlab
q1 = int(f1,z,0,x);
q2 = int(f1,z,0,2) + int(f2,z,2,x);
q3 = int(f1,z,0,2) + int(f2,z,2,4) + int(f3,z,4,x);
````

We are done and are ready to define the model!

````matlab
Model = [implies(region(1), [R1, f == q1])
         implies(region(2), [R2, f == q2])
         implies(region(3), [R3, f == q3])
         sum(region) == 1
         [0 <= x <= 10]];

optimize(Model, -f)
````

Can it get any easier than that?

### Even lazier

Yes it can.

````matlab
f = int(f1,z,0,min(x,2)) + int(f2,z,2,min(x,4)) + int(f3,z,4,x);
optimize([0 <= x <= 10], -f)
````
