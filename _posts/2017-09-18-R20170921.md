### Fixes

* Eliminated some cases where the big-M modelling layer would complain about missing explicit bounds (accidentally introduced in previous release)
* Fixed bug which caused [BONMIN](/solver/bonmin) and [IPOPT](/solver/ipopt) to crash in some instances with convex quadratic constraints
* Fixed bug which caused [bisection](/command/bisection) to crash on infeasible problems
