[Download latest release](/download)

Time to flush out a new release with some significant improvements and fixes.

### Main fixes and additions

* Semidefinite cone supported in [bmibnb](/solver/bmibnb/) without any need for nonlinear SDP solver (detailed post coming!)
* Improved performance in global solver [bmibnb](/solver/bmibnb/) (related post coming!)
* Improved and generalized framework inside [bmibnb](/solver/bmibnb/) (detailed post coming!)
* Improved performance in mixed-integer solver [bnb](/solver/bnb/)
* Support for nonconvex quadratics in [Gurobi](/solver/gurobi)
* Automatically sets 'optimalitytarget' for nonconvex QP in [Cplex](/solver/cplex)
* Support for full options list in [Gurobi](/solver/gurobi)
* Support for full options list in [Xpress](/solver/xpress)
* Support for [Snopt 3.0](/solver/snopt)
* Solver option for [kktqp](/solver/kktqp)
* More informative diagnostics when returning diagnostic code 'solver not applicable'
* [bisection](/solver/bisection) can now be applied to [sum-of-squares programs](/tutorial/sumofsquaresprogramming)
* Correct infeasibility/unboundedness flag returned from [solvesos](/command/solvesos) also when problem has been dualized.
* Octave now works with [fmincon](/solver/fmincon)
