### Fixes


* Support for CPLEX 12.8 (which no longer crashes MATLAB!)
* Fixed bug [#472](https://github.com/yalmip/YALMIP/issues/472) in vectorized implications involving constraints as trigger
* Fixed bug [#471](https://github.com/yalmip/YALMIP/issues/471) outer solver in [bmibnb](yalmip.github.io/solver/bmibnb/) cannot be selected when bmibnb used in [solvebilevel](yalmip.github.io/command/solvebilevel/)
* Fixed bug [#469](https://github.com/yalmip/YALMIP/issues/469) so that size operator works as expected on nD-arrays
* Feature [#465](https://github.com/yalmip/YALMIP/issues/465) [export](yalmip.github.io/command/export/) now supports [intlinprog](yalmip.github.io/solver/intlinprog/)
