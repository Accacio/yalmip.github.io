Primarily improvements in the global solver [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb)

### Fixes

* Fix for wrong diagnostic code when [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb) terminated due to time limit
* Improved performance when [KNITRO](/solver/knitro) is used in [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb) on problems with integer variables
* [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb) can now handle partially given initial guesses (tries to complete the rest by solving linear feasbility problem)
* Converts to full data in [FMINCON](/solver/fmincon) for some algorithmic choices to avoid warnings about sparse data
