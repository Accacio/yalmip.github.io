[sos] is used to define a sum-of-squares constraint.

### Syntax

````matlab
F = sos(p)
````

### Examples
Solving a simple SOS problem and extracting the decomposition is done as

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,1);
p = x^8+x^7+1;
F = sos(p);
solvesos(F);
sdisplay(sosd(F))
ans =
    '0.12828-0.062411x+0.12427x^2-0.49555x^3-0.99602x^4'
    '0.99174+0.008073x-0.018071x^2+0.072068x^3+0.089115x^4'
````
