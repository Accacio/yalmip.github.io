[log] overloads exponential function. In addition to the natural logarithm, YALMIP also overloads [log2] and [log10]. 

Since logarithms easily causes numerical issues in nonlinear solvers, YALMIP also has a  special construction \\( \log(1+x)\\) (shifted log) which automatically is derived from the model. 

### Syntax

````matlab
y = log(x)
y = log2(x)
y = log10(x)
y = slog(x) % Shifted log, typically not used manually
y = log(1+x)
log(1+x)
Nonlinear scalar (real, models 'slog', 1 variable)
````

### Comments

Logarithmic functions are implemented as convexity aware [callback] operators when general nonlinear solvers are used, but can also be represented using [exponential cones](/tutorial/exponentialconeprogramming) when the solvers [SCS] or [ECOS] are used.
