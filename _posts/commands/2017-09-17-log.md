[log] overloads exponential function. In addition to the natural logarithm, YALMIUP also overloads [log2] and [log10]. 

Since logarithms easily causes numerical issues in nonlinear solvers, YALMIP also has a  special construction \\( \log(1+x)\\) (shifted log) . 

### Syntax

````matlab
y = log(x)
y = log2(x)
y = log10(x)
y = slog(x) % Shifted log
````

### Comments

Logarithmic functions are implemented as convexity aware [callback] operators when general nonlinear solvers are used, but can also be represented using [exponential cones](/tutorial/exponentialconeprogramming) when the solvers [SCS] or [ECOS] are used.
