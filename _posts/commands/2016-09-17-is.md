[is] is used to check properties of [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) and constraint objects.

### Syntax

````matlab
yesno = is(x,'property')
````

### Examples

Checking if an [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) object is linear can be done as follows.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,1);
y = [x;x*x];
is(y,'linear')
ans =
     0
````

The command works almost in the same way on constraints, with the difference that the check is performed on every constraint in the set object separately, so the output can be a vector

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,1);
F = [x>=1, [1 x;x 1]>=0, x<=3];
is(F,'elementwise')
ans =
     1
     0
     1
````

Hence, creating a set object containing only the element-wise constraints is done with

````matlab
F_element = F(is(F,'elementwise'));
````

There are numerous conditions that can be checked both for [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) objects

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,1);
is(x,'real')
is(x,'complex')
is(x,'linear')
is(x,'bilinear')
is(x,'quadratic')
is(x,'nonlinear')
is(x,'sigmonial')
is(x,'homogeneous')
is(x,'symmetric')
is(x,'hermitian')
is(x,'scalar')
is(x,'integer')
is(x,'binary')
````

and constraints

````matlabb
x = sdpvar(1,1);
F = set(x > 0);
is(x,'equality')
is(F,'elementwise')
is(x,'socc')
is(x,'sdp')
is(x,'sos')
is(x,'linear')
is(x,'lmi')
````
