[!Graph-based nonlinear operators], [!Mixed-integer based nonlinear operators]


### Syntax

````matlab
y = min(x)
y = min(x,z)
y = min(x,[],dim)
````

### Operator implementation
The concave operator [min] has support for both convex models where [Tutorials.GraphRepresentations| graph representations] can be used, and nonconvex scenarios where [Tutorials.MixedIntegerRepresentations mixed-integer representations are required].
