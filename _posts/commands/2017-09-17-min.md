### Syntax

````matlab
y = min(x)
y = min(x,z)
y = min(x,[],dim)
[y,loc]= min(x,[],dim)
````

### Operator implementation

The convex operator [min] has support for both convex models where a [graph representation] can be used, and nonconvex scenarios where an [integer representation] is required.

If the location index **loc** is requested, an integer model will always be required.
