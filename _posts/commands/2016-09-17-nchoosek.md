[floor](/command/floor) overloads nchoosek operator 

## Syntax

````matlab
y = nchoosek(x,k)
````

## Comments

Note that only **x** can be a decision variable, **k** has to be a constant integer.

The operator is implemented using a [mixed-integer model](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsmixedinteger).
