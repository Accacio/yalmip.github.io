The concave operator [entropy](/command/entropy) is defined as \\( -\sum x_i\log(x_i) \\).

### Syntax

````matlab
y = entropy(x)
````

### Implementation

The concave operator [entropy](/command/entropy) is implemented using the [callback framework](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback]), except when [SCS](/solver/scs) or  [ECOS](/solver/ecos)  is used where the exponential cone description is exploited in a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs).
