The concave operator [entropy](/command/entropy) is defined as \\(-\sum x_i\log(x_i)\).

### Syntax

````matlab
y = entropy(x)
````

### Implementation

The concave operator [entropy](/command/entropy) is implemented using the [evaluation-based nonlinear operators] framework, except when [SCS](/solver/scs) or  [ECOS](/solver/ecos)  is used where the exponential cone description is exploited.
