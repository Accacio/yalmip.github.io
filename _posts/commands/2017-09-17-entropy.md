### Description
The concave operator [entropy ] is defined as '''-sum(x.*log(x))'''.

### Syntax

````matlab
y = entropy(x)
````

### Implementation

The concave operator [entropy], defined as '''-sum(x.*log(x))''' is implemented using the [Tutorials.NonlinearOperators evaluation-based nonlinear operators] framework, except for when [Solvers.SCS scs] or  [Solvers.ECOS ecos]  is used where the exponential cone is used.
