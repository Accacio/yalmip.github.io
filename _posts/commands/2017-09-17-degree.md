[degree] returns the degree of a polynomial

### Syntax

````matlab
d = degree(f,x)
````

### Examples

With only 1 argument, the largest total degree is returned
````matlabb
sdpvar x1 x2
f = x1^2*x2^3 + x1^4;
degree(f)
ans =

     5
````
With two arguments, the degree w.r.t individual variables are returned
````matlabb
degree(f,[x1 x2])

ans =

     4     3
````

The lowest degree can also be extracted
````matlabb
 degree(x1^2*x2^3 + x1^4,[x1 x2],'min')

ans =

     2     0
````
