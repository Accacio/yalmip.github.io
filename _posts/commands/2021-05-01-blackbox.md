[blackbox](/command/blackbox) can be used to apply essentially arbitrary unsupported operators on [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) objects

### Syntax


````matlab
y = blackbox(f,x)
y = blackbox(f,x,df)
````

### Examples

General nonlinear functions are supported through the [callback nonlinear operator framework]. Most functions (exponentials, logarithms, trigonometrics, etc.) are available from start, but the user can use [blackbox](/command/blackbox) as a last black-box resort to define other (elementwise) functions, without going through the hassle of creating new full-fledged operators.

The following example shows how we can use a nonlinear solver to find a local optimizer to a small trigonometric problem. Of course,  **sin** is already overloaded but we use it here for illustrative purposes).

````matlab
sdpvar x
y = blackbox(@sin,10*x)
optimize([-pi <= x <= pi],y+abs(x))
````

### Comments

Note that these functions should be used with care in the global solver [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb). The reason is that the global solver needs bounding functions etc for performance (and correctness). Since these are missing (they are approximated by sampling the function along its domain), the global solver is not guaranteed to work.  If you really need a new nonlinear operator to be strictly supported in [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb) (i.e. with an optimized bounding strategy), make a feature request.
