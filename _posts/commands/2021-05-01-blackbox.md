[blackbox](/command/blackbox) can be used to apply essentially arbitrary unsupported operators on [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) objects.

### Syntax


````matlab
y = blackbox(f,x)
y = blackbox(f,x,df)
````

### Examples

Nonlinear functions are supported through the [callback nonlinear operator framework](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback). Most functions (exponentials, logarithms, trigonometrics, etc.) are available from start, but the user can use [blackbox](/command/blackbox) as a last resort to define other (elementwise) functions, without going through the hassle of creating completely defined operators.

The following example shows how we can use a nonlinear solver to find a local optimizer to a small trigonometric problem. Of course, all involved operators here are already supported natively, so the use of [blackbox](/command/blackbox) is only for illustration. THe important difference is that YALMIP never sees cosine, sine or quadratics in the first approach. It will only be given iterates of \\(x\\) from the solver, and then call the black-box function and return the function value to the solver. In the standard second model, YALMIP will explicitly work with the computational tree of the expression.

````matlab
sdpvar x
y = blackbox(@(x)(sin(cos(x^2))),x)
optimize([1 <= x <= 2],y)

optimize([1 <= x <= 2],sin(cos(x^2)))
````

If you have the function implemented in a file, you can use a function handle or a file name.

````matlab
y = blackbox(@myfile,x)
y = blackbox('myfile',x)
````

As an example of a more complicated scenario, let us maximize \\(\int_0^a (x^2-x^3)dx\\) with respect to the integration limit \\(a \geq 0\\). To implement the integral, we use the MATLAB command integral which takes a function handle and the two limits, which in our case means one of the limit arguments is a decision variable.

````matlab
f = @(a)(integral(@(x) x.^2-x.^3,0,a))
sdpvar a
Area = blackbox(f,a);
optimize(a>=0,-Area)
````

In our examples above, the solver will use numerical differentiation, but if we have a gradient availale, we can supply it.

````matlab
f = @(a)(integral(@(x) x.^2-x.^3,0,a))
sdpvar a
df = @(a)(a^2-a^3);
Area = blackbox(f,a,df);
optimize(a>=0,-Area)
````

### Comments

Note that [blackbox](/command/blackbox) should be used with care in the global solver [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb). The reason is that the global solver needs bounding functions etc for performance (and correctness). Since these are missing (they are approximated by sampling the function along its domain), the global solver is not guaranteed to work.
