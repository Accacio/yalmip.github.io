Images:mini-category.gif  [!Logic constraints], [!Mixed-integer based nonlinear operators]


### Syntax

````matlab
F = implies(A,B)
````

### Examples

[implies] is used to define logic implications. As an example, the following code will ensure that a variable '''x''' satisfies a set of linear inequalities if a binary variable '''d''' is true
````matlabb
d = binvar(1);
F = implies(d,A*x <= b);
````

[implies] is mainly intended for (BINARY -> BINARY) or (BINARY -> Linear constraint), although it can be used also for more general constructions such as (Linear Constraint -> Linear Constraint) (bearing in mind that these models typically are numerically sensitive and may require a lot of binary variables to modeled).

The following code reverts the logic: if a set of linear inequalities are satisfied, the binary variable is forced to be true.
````matlabb
d = binvar(1);
F = implies(A*x <= b, d);
````

For more examples, check out the [Tutorials.LogicProgramming logic programming tutorial].

### Comments
Since [implies] is implemented using a [Tutorials.Big-M big-M] approach, it is crucial that all involved variables have explicit bound constraints.
