[geomean](/command/geomean) is a convexity aware operator for geometric mean

### Syntax

````matlab
y = geomean(x)
````

### Comments

The operator behaves like the built-in **geomean** command, with the addition that [geomean](/command/geomean) applied to an Hermitian matrix returns the geometric mean of the eigenvalues.

The operator is implemented using a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) based on [SOCP](/tags#second-order-cone-programming) (standard vector case)  and [SDP](/tags#semidefinite-programming) (for the eigenvalue case) reformulations, and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity and use conic graph representations.

The geometric mean of the eigenvalues of a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix is a monotonic function of the determinant, and can thus be used as an alternative in [determinant maximization](/tutorial/maxdetprogramming)
