[det](/command/det) overloads determinant in two different ways

### Syntax

````matlab
y = det(X)
y = det(X,'polynomial')
````

### Comments

By default, YALMIP will create a [callback operators](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback) to deal with the determinant. This means that function values and derivatives are computed when the solver asks for these. This means you must use a callback based solver (nonlinear solvers such as [FMINCON](/solver/fmincon), [IPOPT](/solver/ipopt) and [KNITRO](/solver/PENLAB).

Alternatively, you can ask YALMIP to derive the symbolic polynomial expression of the polynomial. This will enable use of [PENLAB](/solver/penlab) and [PENBMI](/solver/penbmi). Note that the polynomial representation of the determinant has horrible complexity and only can be used on very small and/or sparse matrices.

If you apply [log](/command/log) on a callback based [det](/command/det) expression, a [logdet](/command/logdet) object will automatically be created.
