[rcone] is used to simplify or speed up definition of rotated Lorentz cone constraints \\(z^Tz \leq 2xy, x\geq 0, y\geq 0\\)

### Syntax

````matlab
c = rcone(z,x,y)
````

### Examples

Constraining the squared Euclidean norm of a vector \\(x\\) to be less than \\(t\\) can be done by using standard MATLAB code. YALMIP will automatically convert this to a corresponding SOCP if required, or treat it as a general quadratic constraint if a nonlinear solver is used.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(n,1);
F = [x'*x <= t];
````

An alternative is to do this using a rotated Lorentz cone, if we know an SOCP solver will be used. The advantage is that the compilation of the optimization problem is faster (for large arguments)

````matlabb
x = sdpvar(n,1);
F = [rcone(x,t,1/2)];
````

This is equivalent to
````matlabb
x = sdpvar(n,1);
F = [cone(1+t,[2*x;1-t])];
````

### Comments

YALMP now detects rotated Lorentz cones automatically from models of the type \\(z^Tz \leq 2xy, x\geq 0, y\geq 0\\). Note the positivty conditions have to be included in the model, otherwise the constraint is nonconvex and no cone constraint can be defined.
