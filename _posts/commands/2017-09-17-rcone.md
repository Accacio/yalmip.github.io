[rcone] is used to simplify definition of rotated Lorentz cone constraints \\(z^Tz \leq 2xy, x\geq 0, y\geq 0\\)

### Syntax

````matlab
c = rcone(z,x,y)
````

!Examples

Constraining the squared Euclidean norm of a vector to be less than '''t''' can be done by using standard MATLAB code. YALMIP will automatically convert this to a corresponding SOCP if required, or treat it as a general quadratic constraint if a nonlinear solver is used.
````matlabb
x = sdpvar(n,1);
F = [x'*x <= t];
````

An alternative is to do this using a rotated Lorentz cone, if we know an SOCP solver will be used. The advantage is that the compilation of the optimization problem is faster (for large arguments)
````matlabb
x = sdpvar(n,1);
F = [rcone(x,t,1/2)];
````

### Comments

The command will probably be removed in a future version.
