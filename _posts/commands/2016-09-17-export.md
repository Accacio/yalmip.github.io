[export](/command/export) is used to export YALMIP models to various numerical solver formats.

### Syntax

````matlab
 [model,recoverymodel,diagnostic,internalmodel] = export(F,h,ops)
````

### Examples

Consider a Lyapunov stability problem

````matlab
A = randn(5,5);A = -A*A';
P = sdpvar(5,5);
F = [A'*P+P*A <= 0, P >= eye(5)];
obj = trace(P);
````

Exporting this to a model in [sedumi](/solver/sedumi) format is done by specifying the solver and calling export in the same way as [optimize](/command/optimize) would have ben called.

````matlab
[model,recoverymodel] = export(F,obj,sdpsettings('solver','sedumi'));
model =
       A: [50x15 double]
       b: [15x1 double]
       C: [50x1 double]
       K: [1x1 struct]
    pars: [1x1 struct]
````

The data in **recoverymodel**  can be used to relate a solution obtained from using the exported model, to the actual variables in YALMIP.

````matlab
[x,y] = sedumi(model.A,model.b,model.C,model.K);
assign(recover(recoverymodel.used_variables),y);
````

Some solvers do not support equality constraints. One way to handle this in YALMIP is to use ````sdpsettings('remove',1)````. If this is done, YALMIP derives a basis and solves the problem in the reduced variables. This basis is communicated through the structure **recoverymodel**.

````matlab
ops = sdpsettings('solver','sedumi','remove',1);
[model,recoverymodel] = export([F, trace(P)==10],obj,ops);
[x,y] = sedumi(model.A,model.b,model.C,model.K);
z = recoverymodel.x_equ + recoverymodel.H*y;
assign(recover(recoverymodel.used_variables),z);
````

If the compilation of the numerical model fails for some reason, then this will be reported in the third output **diagnostic**.

The general internal numerical solver-agnostic model that YALMIP compiles is returned in the fourth output **internalmodel**
