[logistic] is a convexity aware operator

### Syntax

````matlab
y = logistic(x)
````

### Implementation

The operator [logistic], defined as \\(\frac{1}{1+exp^{-x}}\\) (concave if its argument is guaranteed to be positive, and convex if guaranteed negative) is implemented using the [evaluation-based nonlinear operators] framework.
