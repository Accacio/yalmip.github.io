### Syntax

````matlab
y = logistic(x)
````

### Implementation

The operator [logistic], defined as '''1./(1+exp(-x))''' (concave if its argument is guaranteed to be positive, and convex if guaranteed negative) is implemented using the [Tutorials.NonlinearOperators evaluation-based nonlinear operators] framework.
