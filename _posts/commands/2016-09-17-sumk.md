[sumk](/command/sumk) implements an operator which returns the sum of the k largest values of a vector, or sum of k largest eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix. A weighted sum is also possible, with a non-increasing non-negative weight vector p.

## Syntax

````matlab
y = sumk(x,k)
y = sumk(x,k,p)
````

### Operator implementation

The operator is implemented using a [linear programming based graph model](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) for the vector case, and a [semidefinite programming based graph model](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) for the symmetric matrix case.
