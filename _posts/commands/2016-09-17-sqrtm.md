### Syntax 
````matlab
y = sqrtm(x)
````

### Comment

The positive increasing concave operator [sqrtm](/command/sqrtm) is implemented using the [callback-based nonlinear operators] framework. It is thus used when you use a general purpose nonlinear solver (such as [FMINCON](/solver/fmincon) or [IPOPT]). If you want to obtain a graph-representation using second-order cone constraints, use [sqrt](/command/sqrt) instead. Read more about the [difference between sqrt and sqrtm in YALMIP].
