[sqrtm](/command/sqrtm) overleads sqrtm

## Syntax
````matlab
y = sqrtm(x)
````

### Comment

The operator is implemented as a [callback operator](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback). It is thus used when you use a general purpose nonlinear solver (such as [FMINCON](/solver/fmincon), [IPOPT](/solver/ipopt), [IPOPT](/solver/ipopt) or [KNITRO](/solver/knitro). If you want to obtain a [graph-representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) using second-order cone constraints, use [sqrt](/command/sqrt) instead.
