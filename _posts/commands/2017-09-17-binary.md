[binary] is used to constrain a variable to be binary.

### Syntax

````matlab
F = binary(x)
````


### Examples

Setting up a binary linear program can be done as

````matlab
x = binvar(n,1);
optimize(A*x<b,c'*x)
````

or

````matlab
x = sdpvar(n,1);
optimize([A*x<=b, binary(x)],c'*x)
````

The binary constraint is imposed on the *involved* variables, not the actual expression. Hence, the following two constraints are equivalent

````matlab
F = binary(x);
F = binary(pi+sqrt(2)*x);
````

### Comment
If possible, use [binvar] instead as there are some parts in YALMIP where it can exploit integrality on an earlier stage if the varaibles have been defined as such.
