[exp] overloads exponential function.

### Syntax

````matlab
y = exp(x)
````

### Comments

The convex exponential operator is implemented as a convexity aware [callback] operator when general nonlinear solvers are used, but can also be represented using [exponential cones](/tutorial/exponentialconeprogramming) when the solvers [SCS] or [ECOS] are used.
