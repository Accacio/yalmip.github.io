[value] is used to extract the numerical value of a decision variable (replaces [double])

### Syntax

````matlab
Y = value(X)
````

### Examples
After solving an optimization problem we can extract the optimal objective value and solution.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(2,1);
F = [-1 <= x <= 1];
obj = sum(x);
optimize(F,obj);
optobj = value(obj)
optx = value(x)
````
