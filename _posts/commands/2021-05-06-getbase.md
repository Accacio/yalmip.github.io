[getbase](/command/getbase) returns the full basis used in an [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) expression.

### Syntax

````matlab
B = getbase(x)
````

### Examples

Expressions are built-up from internal variable indicies ([getvariables](/command/getvariables)) and a basis ([getbase](/command/getbase)). We can extract the full basis (stacked vectorized columnwise in sparse format)

````matlab
yalmip('clear')
x = sdpvar(1);
y = sdpvar(1);
z = [1 2*x;3*y 4*x+5*y + 6*x^2];

full(getbase(z))

ans =

     1     0     0     0
     0     0     3     0
     0     2     0     0
     0     4     5     6

````

To extract a single basis associated with a variable index [getbasematrix](/command/getbasematrix) is used.
