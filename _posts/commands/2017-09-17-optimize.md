[optimize] is the common function for solving optimization problems (replaces [solvesdp])

### Syntax

````matlab
diagnostics = optimize(Constraints,Objective,options) 
````

### Examples 

A linear program \\( \textbf{min } c^Tx \textbf{subject to }Ax \leq  b\\) can be solved with the following piece of code

````matlab
x = sdpvar(length(c),1);
F = [A*x<=b];
h = c'*x;
optimize(F,h);
solution = value(x);
````

If we only look for a feasible solution, we can omit the objective function 

````matlab
optimize(F);
````

A diagnostic structure is returned from solvesdp, which can be used, e.g, to check feasibility (see [yalmiperror] for the error codes)

````matlab
diagnostics = optimize(F);
if diagnostics.problem == 0
 disp('Feasible')
elseif diagnostics.problem == 1
 disp('Infeasible')
else
 disp('Something else happened')
end
````
 
Solving the feasibility problem with a particular solver, e.g. [QUADPROG], can be done with 

````matlab
optimize(F,[],sdpsettings('solver','quadprog'));
```` 

Minimization is assumed, hence if we want to maximize, we simply flip the sign of the objective.

````matlab
optimize(F,-h);
````
