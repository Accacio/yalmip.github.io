[sosmodel] derives the semidefinite program to compute a sum-of-squares decomposition.

### Syntax

````matlab
[F,obj,m] = sosmodel(Constraints,Objective,options,decisionvariables) 
````

### Examples

The following example sets up the SDP required to find a lower bound of a polynomial, using sum-of-squares. The last output contains the monomials YALMIP employs to find the decomposition

````matlab
sdpvar x t
p = x^4+x+5;
Model = [sos(p-t)];
[F,objective,monomials] = compilesos(Model,-t,[],t)
sdisplay(monomials{1})
````
The optimization problem can now be solved

````matlab
optimize(F,objective)
````

Note that YALMIP by default derives an image model (dual form) for sum-of-squares programs when [sosmodel] is used, in contrast to a kernel model (primal form) used by default in [solvesos]. With this, we can be enured that the resulting model is expressed in terms of the original variables and additional new variables, in contrast to a primal form where all original variables are lost. If you want to have a primal form (which typically has better computational properties), you have to set **sos.model** to 1 in an options structure.
