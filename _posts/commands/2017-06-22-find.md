[find](/command/find) partially overloads the find operator on a vector. The find operator returns the index to the ''first'' non-zero value of a vector. If there is no non-zero value, the index is defined as ''length(x)+1'' (as a decision variable cannot be empty, which would be MATLAB standard for the find operator).

### Syntax

````matlab
[index,value] = find(x)
````

### Examples

As an example, the following problem should lead to the last element of ''x'' set to 1 and all other elements zero.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,5);
y = binvar(1,5);
[index,nonzerovalue] = find(x);
optimize([x == y, sum(y)==1, -10 <= x <= 10],-index);
````

Since the index can be larger than the length of the vector, to support the case when there are no non-zeros, one should not use the found index for indexing as in ''x(index)'' but instead the second output (which will be 0 if there are nonnonzeros). The following model should lead to ''x=0'' with ''nonzerovalue'' set to 0.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,5);
y = binvar(1,5);
[index,nonzerovalue] = find(x);
optimize([x == y, -10 <= x <= 10],nonzerovalue);
````

### Comments

The operator is implemented using a [mixed-integer model](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsmixedinteger). based on [big-M](/tutorial/bigmandconvexhulls) approach, hence it is crucial that all involved variables have explicit bound constraints.

Most often, you can create a model without using the find operator, and using this operator is typically a sign of a model which you can improve significantly.
