[sign](/command/sign) overloads sign operator

### Syntax

````matlab
y = sign(X)
````

### Comments

The operator is implemented using a [mixed-integer model](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsmixedinteger) based on a [big-M](/tutorial/bigmandconvexhulls) approach, hence it is crucial that all involved variables have explicit bound constraints.

Since the operator is discontinuous at 0, behaviour at that point is not numerically stable.
