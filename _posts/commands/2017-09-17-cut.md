[cut] is used to define user-specified cuts for the global solver [BMIBNB].

### Syntax

````matlab
F = cut(X,'tag')
````

### Examples

The result from the command is nothing but a standard constraint.

````matlab
P = sdpvar(2,2);
F = cut((P-eye(2))*(P-eye(2))>=0);

The only difference is that this constraint will not be used in the upper bound problem in the branch & bound procedure. The constraint will thus only be used to improve the lower bound relaxations.
