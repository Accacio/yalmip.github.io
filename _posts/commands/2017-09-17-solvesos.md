[solvesos] computes sum-of-squares decompositions.

### Syntax

````matlab
[sol,u,Q] = solvesos(Constraints,Objective,options,decisionvariables)
````

### Examples
In its most simple form, [solvesos] takes a [sos] constrained polynomial and calculates a sum-of-squares decomposition.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,1);
p = x^4+x+5;
F = [sos(p)];
sol = solvesos(F);
if sol.problem == 0
 disp('Sum-of-squares decomposition possible!);
end
````

If you are not interested in the used monomials \\(u(x)\\) and the Gramian \\(Q\\) available from [solvesos] in the second and third output, and the parameters in the problem are obvious from the constraints and the objective (see below), you can simply use [optimize] instead, and [solvesos] will be called automatically

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,1);
p = x^4+x+5;
F = [sos(p)];
optimize(F);
````

The sum-of-squares decomposition gives \\(p(x) = u^T(x)Qu(x)=v^T(x)v(x)\\). The computed decomposition \\(v(x)\\) can be recovered using the command [sosd].

````matlab
v = sosd(F);
sdisplay(p-v'*v)
ans =
    '-1.7764e-015+7.7716e-016x-1.1102e-015x^4'
````

Alternatively,

````matlab
[sol,u,Q] = solvesos(F);
sdisplay(p-u{1}'*Q{1}*u{1})
ans =
    '-1.7764e-015+7.7716e-016x-1.1102e-015x^4'
````

Obviously, not entirely correct. However the coefficients are small and most likely due to numerical inaccuracy. Remove all terms with coefficients smaller than 1e-6 using the command [clean].

````matlab
sdisplay(clean(p-u{1}'*Q{1}*u{1},1e-6))
ans =
    '0'
````

Parametrized sum-of-squares problems are also possible. As an example, a lower bound on the global minimum of \\(p(x)\\) is obtained by finding a decomposition of \\(p(x)-t\\), while maximizing \\(t\\)

````matlab
t = sdpvar(1,1);
F = [sos(p-t)];
solvesos(F,-t,[],t);
value(t)
ans =
    4.5275
````  

Parametric variables (the last argument in the code above) are automatically detected if they are part of the objective function or part of non-SOS constraints. Hence, the problem above can be simplified (it is however recommended that you keep track of all decision variables and explicitly tell YALMIP which they are)

````matlab
t = sdpvar(1,1);
F = [sos(p-t)];
optimize(F,-t);
value(t)
ans =
    4.5275
````  

There is a large number of additional features in YALMIPs sum-of-squares module. To learn more check out the [sum-of-squares tutorial](/tutorial/asumofsquaresprogramming).
