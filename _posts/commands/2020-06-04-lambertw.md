[lambertw](/command/lambertw) is defined as the solution to  \\(W(x)\exp^{W(x)} = x\\).

## Syntax

````matlab
y = lambertw(x)
````

### Implementation

The operator operator is implemented using the [callback framework](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback), except when [Mosek 9](/solver/mosek), [SCS](/solver/scs) or  [ECOS](/solver/ecos)  are used and the [exponential cone description](/tutorial/exponentialcone) is exploited in a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs).
