[interp1](/command/interp1) overloads interp1, with additional flags for a creating mixed-integer [sos2](/command/sos2)-based approximation or standard convex epigraph representations.

### Syntax

````matlab
y = interp1(xdata,ydata,x,'method')
````

### Example (Nonlinear optimization)

Create a nonlinear function over a grid and find the global minima of a spline interpolated version of the nonlinear function, using the global solver [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb).

````matlab
xi = (-5:.1:5);
yi = sin(xi) + cos(xi.^2).*sin(xi).^2

sdpvar x
y = interp1(xi,yi,x,'spline');
optimize([],y,sdpsettings('solver','bmibnb'));
plot(xi,yi);hold on;
xii = (-5:0.001:5);
plot(xii,interp1(xi,yi,xii,'spline'));
plot(xii,sin(xii) + cos(xii.^2).*sin(xii).^2)
plot(value(x),value(y),'k*')
````
Alternatively, we can use a linear approximation (still implemented as a nonlinear function using a [callback framework](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback))

````matlab
y = interp1(xi,yi,x,'linear');
optimize([],y,sdpsettings('solver','bmibnb'));
plot(xi,yi);hold on;
xii = (-5:0.001:5);
plot(xii,interp1(xi,yi,xii,'linear'));
plot(xii,sin(xii) + cos(xii.^2).*sin(xii).^2)
plot(value(x),value(y),'k*')
````

Of course, in this particular case could have worked with the nonlinear function directly which most likely is more efficient as it is composed of very simple operators.

````matlab
y = sin(x)+cos(x^2)*sin(x)^2
optimize([-5 <= x <= 5],y,sdpsettings('solver','bmibnb'))
plot(value(x),value(y),'r*')
````


### Example (Linear optimization)

With the flag **'milp'** a [sos2](/command/sos2) representation of the piecewise affine function interpolating the supplied data points is created, and thus requires a [sos2](/command/sos2)-capable [mixed-integer linear solver](/tag#mixed-integer-linear-programming-solver).

````matlab
y = interp1(xi,yi,x,'milp');
optimize([],y)
````

For problems where the data represents a convex (or concave) function and convexity of the problem can be derived, we can (and should!) use a simple linear epigraph (hypograph) representation. This is obtained with the flag **'graph'**. YALMIP will automatically analyze the data and the problem to check convexity. Note that the approximator will create hyperplanes going through neighbouring data points, and thus create an upper approximation of convex functions, and a lower approximation of concave functions

````matlab
yi = 15*xi.^2 - xi.^3 + 20*xi;
y = interp1(xi,yi,x,'graph');
optimize([],y);
clf;
plot(xii,interp1(xi,yi,xii,'linear'));
hold on
plot(value(x),value(y),'r*')
````

When talking about graph models, one typically thinks of tight underestimators for convex functions. Hence, a more natural piecewise affine approximation is based on tangent cuts, instead of interpolation. This can be achieved by supplying an additional input with derivatives. To see the difference between these models, we approximate a quadratic coarsely using both interpolants and tangents to generate the hyperplanes

````matlab
xi = -1:1/2:1;
yi = xi.^2;
dyi = 2*xi;

sdpvar x f
f = interp1(xi,yi,x,'graph',dyi);
plot(f <= 1,[x;f]);hold on
f = interp1(xi,yi,x,'graph');
plot(f <= 1,[x;f],'yellow');

xifine = -1:0.001:1;
yifine = xifine.^2;
l = plot(xifine,yifine,'b')
plot(xi,yi,'k*')
````

If convexity assumptions fail, an error will be generated. If we want YALMIP to adaptively select between an efficient graph model and a MILP based model, we use the flag **'lp'** instead.


````matlab
yi = 15*xi.^2 - 2*xi.^3 + 20*xi;
y = interp1(xi,yi,x,'lp');
optimize([],y);
clf;
plot(xii,interp1(xi,yi,xii,'linear'));
hold on
plot(value(x),value(y),'r*')
````

If you have nonconvex data, but want to create an LP-based epigraph representation of the lower convex envelope, you can use the flag **'envelope'** and the data will automatically be pruned

````matlab
xi = 1:0.01:4;
yi = sin(3*xi)./xi;

sdpvar x f
f = interp1(xi,yi,x,'envelope');
plot(f <= 1,[x;f]);hold on

xifine = 1:0.001:4;
yifine = sin(3*xifine)./xifine;
plot(xifine,yifine,'b')
````

## Implementation

In the nonlinear case when the operator is implemented using the [callback framework](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback), the operator does not compute derivatives, which can lead to slow computations (and in general, computing a single function value is expensive).
