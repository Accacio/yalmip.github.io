### Syntax

````matlab
y = max(x)
y = max(x,z)
y = max(x,[],dim)
````

### Operator implementation
The convex operator [max] has support for both convex models where [Tutorials.GraphRepresentations| graph representations] can be used, and nonconvex scenarios where [Tutorials.MixedIntegerRepresentations mixed-integer representations are required].
