[zeros](/command/zeros) can be used to avoid the dreaded [NaN in model](naninmodel) failure

### Syntax

````matlab
X = zeros(n,m,'like',sdpvar)
````

### Examples

The typical scenario when we would use [zeros](/command/zeros) is when we want to create a matrix which is almost all zeros, except for some elements.

The following version will fail as discussed in the post [NaN in model](https://yalmip.github.io/naninmodel/)

````matlab
y = sdpvar(1,1);
X = zeros(5,5);
X(1,5) = y;
````

A natural way around this issue is to simply construct the matrix using concatenation

````matlab
y = sdpvar(1,1);
X = [zeros(1,4) y;zeros(4,5)];
````

An alternative is to first create an overloaded zero, which is nothing but an [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) without any variables

````matlab
y = sdpvar(1,1);
X = zeros(5,5,'like',sdpvar);
X(1,5) = y;
````

This only works in recent MATLAB versions though. An ugly alternative is [double2sdpvar](/command/double2sdpvar)
````matlab
y = sdpvar(1,1);
X = double2sdpvar(zeros(5,5))
X(1,5) = y;
````
