[geomean](/command/harmmean) is a convexity aware operator for geometric mean

### Syntax

````matlab
y = harmmean(x)
````

### Comments

The operator behaves like the built-in **harmmean** command.

The operator is implemented using a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) based on [SOCP](/tags#second-order-cone-programming) (standard vector case)  and [SDP](/tags#semidefinite-programming) (for the eigenvalue case) reformulations, and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity and use conic epigraph representations.
