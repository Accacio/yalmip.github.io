[optimize] is the common function for solving optimization problems.

### Syntax

````matlab
diagnostics = optimize(Constraints,Objective,options)
````

### Examples

A linear program can be solved with the following piece of code

````matlab
x = sdpvar(length(c),1);
F = [A*x<=b];
h = c'*x;
optimize(F,h);
solution = value(x);
````

If we only look for a feasible solution, we can omit the objective function

````matlab
optimize(F);
````

A diagnostic structure is returned from solvesdp, which can be used, e.g, to check feasibility as reported by the solver (see [yalmiperror] for the error codes)

````matlab
diagnostics = optimize(F);
if diagnostics.problem == 0
 disp('Solver thinks it is feasible')
elseif diagnostics.problem == 1
 disp('Solver thinks it is infeasible')
else
 disp('Something else happened')
end
````

Solving the feasibility problem with a particular solver, e.g. [QUADPROG], can be done by creating an options structure

````matlab
options = sdpsettings('solver','quadprog')
optimize(F,[],options);
````

Minimization is assumed, hence if we want to maximize, we simply flip the sign of the objective.

````matlab
optimize(F,-h);
````
