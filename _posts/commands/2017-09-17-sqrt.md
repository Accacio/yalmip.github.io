### Syntax
````matlab
y = sqrt(x)
````

### Comment

The convex operator [sqrt] is implemented using a [graph representation] based on a second-order cone programming model, and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity. If you want to avoid a graph-representation using second-order cone constraints and instead use a standard nonlinear programming approach, use [sqrtm] instead. Read more about the [difference between [sqrt] and [sqrtm] in YALMIP].
