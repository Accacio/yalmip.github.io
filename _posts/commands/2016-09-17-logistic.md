[logistic](/command/logistic) is an implementation of the logistic function

### Syntax

````matlab
y = logistic(x)
````

### Implementation

The operator [logistic](/command/logistic), defined as \\(\frac{1}{1+exp^{-x}}\\) (concave if its argument is guaranteed to be positive, and convex if guaranteed negative) is implemented using the [callback operator](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback) framework.
