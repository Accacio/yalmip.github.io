[sparse](/command/sparse) is used to create sdpvar objects  with a certain structure.
 
## Syntax 

````matlab
x = sparse(i,j,s,n,m) 
````

## Examples 

Creating a diagonal matrix with every second diagonal element zero can be done as

````matlab
x = sparse(1:2:2*n,1:2:2*n,sdpvar(n,1))
````

The command works exactly as the normal sparse command. Hence, **help sparse** will give you the details.
