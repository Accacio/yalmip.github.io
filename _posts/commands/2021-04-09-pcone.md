[pcone](/command/pcone) is used to define the power cone constraint \\( \left \lvert z \right\rvert_2 \leq x^{\alpha}y^{1-\alpha}, x\geq 0, y\geq 0 \\) for constant \\( 0 < \alpha < 1\\).

## Syntax

````matlab
Model = pcone(x,y,z,alpha)
Model = pcone([x;y;z;alpha]) % Stacked form
Model = pcone([X;Y;Z;Alpha]) % Stacked vectorized form (each column defines a power cone
