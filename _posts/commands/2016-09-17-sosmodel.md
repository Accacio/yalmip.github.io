[sosmodel](/command/sosmodel) derives the semidefinite program used to compute a sum-of-squares decomposition, without solving it.

## Syntax

````matlab
[F,obj,m] = sosmodel(Constraints,Objective,options,decisionvariables)
````

## Examples

The following example sets up the SDP required to find a lower bound of a polynomial, using sum-of-squares. The last output contains the monomials YALMIP uses in the decomposition.  To make it easier to see the connection between the polynomial and the derived decomposition, we turn off a scaling feature. YALMIP has introduced 1 new variable, i.e., there is a degree-of-freedom in a sum-of-squares representation of a quartic.

````matlab
sdpvar x t
p = 8*x^4+x+5;
Model = [sos(p-t)];
[F,objective,monomials] = sosmodel(Model,-t,sdpsettings('sos.scale',0),t);
sdisplay(sdpvar(F(1)))
ans =

    '5-t'                    '0.5'                   '-0.4472*internal(1)'
    '0.5'                    '0.8944*internal(1)'    '0'                  
    '-0.4472*internal(1)'    '0'                     '8'  
sdisplay(monomials{1})
ans =

    '1'
    'x'
    'x^2'

````
The optimization problem can be solved or manipulated as any other model.

````matlab
optimize(F,objective)
````

Note that YALMIP by default derives an image model (dual form) for sum-of-squares programs when [sosmodel](/command/sosmodel) is used, in contrast to a kernel model (primal form) used by default in [solvesos](/command/solvesos). With this, we can be assured that the resulting model is expressed in terms of the original variables and possibly new additional variables, in contrast to a primal form where all original variables are lost. If you want to have a primal form (which typically has better computational properties), you have to set **sos.model** to 1 in an options structure.
