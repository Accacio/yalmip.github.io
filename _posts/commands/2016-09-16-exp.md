[exp](/command/exp) overloads the exponential function.

### Syntax

````matlab
y = exp(x)
````

### Comments

The convex exponential operator is implemented as a convexity aware  [callback operator](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback) when general nonlinear solvers are used, but can also be represented using [exponential cones](/tutorial/exponentialconeprogramming) when the solvers [SCS](/solver/scs) or [ECOS](/solver/ecos) are used.
