[exp](/command/exp) overloads the exponential function.

### Syntax

````matlab
y = exp(x)
````

### Comments

The convex exponential operator is implemented as a  [callback operator](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback), except when [Mosek 9](/solver/mosek), [SCS](/solver/scs) or [ECOS](/solver/ecos) are used and the exponential cone description is exploited in a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs).
