### Syntax

````matlab
y = abs(x)
````

### Operator implementation

Absolute value [abs](/command/abs) has support for both convex models where [graph representations] are used, and nonconvex scenarios where [mixed-integer representations are required].

For complex-valued arguments, [norm](/command/norm)(x) is returned.
