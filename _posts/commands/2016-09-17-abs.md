### Syntax

````matlab
y = abs(x)
````

### Operator implementation

The operator has support for both convex models where linear [graph representations](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) are used, and nonconvex scenarios where linear [mixed-integer representations](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsmixedinteger) are required.

For complex-valued arguments, [norm](/command/norm)(x) is returned.
