[huber](/command/huber) implements the huber loss, defined as  \\(x^2\\) when \\( \left\lvert x\right\rvert \leq M \\) and \\( 2\left\lvert x\right\rvert -M\\) for \\(   \left\lvert x\right\rvert  \geq M\\)

### Syntax

````matlab
y = huber(x,M)
````

### Comments

The operator is implemented using a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) based on [SOCP](/tags#second-order-cone-programming) and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity and use a conic model.
