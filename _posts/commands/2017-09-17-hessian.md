[hessian] calculates the Hessian \\(d^2^f/dx^2\\) of a polynomial expression

### Syntax

````matlab
H = hessian(f,x)
````

### Examples

With only 1 argument, the differentiation is performed with respect to all involved variables

````matlab
x1 = sdpvar(1,1);
x2 = sdpvar(1,1);
f = x1^4+5*x2^2;
sdisplay(hessian(f))
ans =
    '12*x1^2'    '0'
    '0'         '10'
````

Giving a second argument controls what variables to differentiate with respect to

````matlab
sdisplay(hessian(f,x1))
ans =
    '12x1^2'
````
