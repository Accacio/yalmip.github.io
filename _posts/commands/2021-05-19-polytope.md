[polytope](/command/polytope) either converts a set of vertices to a set defining a polytope (in a lifted space), or converts a polytopic set to an [MPT polytope](/command/mpt)

### Syntax

````matlab
P = polytope(x,v)
P = polytope(M)
````

### Example

The native YALMIP use is for defing a polytope \\(x = \sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i v_i, \lambda \geq 0, \sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i = 1\\) from a set of vertices \\( v_i\\).

````matlab
v = randn(2,10);
x = sdpvar(2,1);
P = polytope(x,v)
````

The opeprator does not perform any convex hull computation to reduce the numer of vertices. Note also that the polytope is defined in the \\(x,\lambda\\)-space. Hence, if you want plot it, you are most likely interested in the projection to \\(x\\)

````matlab
plot(P,x)
````

The command also serves as the interface between YALMIP objects and [MPT](/solver/MPT) objects, allow us to convert objects. To generate a polytopic [MPT](/solver/MPT) object, simply apply the operator on a purely linear object.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(2,1);
P = polytope([-1 <= x <= 1]);
````
