[sos2](/command/sos2) creates a [special ordered set of type 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_ordered_set) constraint on a vector (at most two of the variables are non-zero, and the non-zero variables must be consecutive in their ordering)

### Syntax

````matlab
F = sos2(X,AdjecencyWeights);
````

### Example

[sos2](/command/sos2) constraints are often used to model piecewise linear approximations of nonlinear functions.

````matlab
xi = linspace(0,2*pi,25)';
f1 = sin(xi);
f2 = cos(xi).^3;
plot(xi,f1+f2)

sdpvar x y1 y2
lambda1 = sdpvar(length(f1),1)
lambda2 = sdpvar(length(f2),1)
F = [sos2(lambda1), sos2(lambda2)]
F = [F, x == lambda1'*xi, y1 == lambda1'*f1,lambda1>=0,sum(lambda1)==1]
F = [F, x == lambda2'*xi, y2 == lambda2'*f2,lambda2>=0,sum(lambda2)==1]
optimize(F,y1+y2)
x
y1+y2
````

### Comments

The command can currently only be used if you have [GUROBI](/solver/gurobi), [CPLEX](/solver/cplex), [SCIP](/solver/scip) or  [LPSOLVE](/solver/lpsolve).
