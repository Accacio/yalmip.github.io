[median] overloads median operator with a mixed-integer model

### Syntax

````matlab
m = median(X)
````

### Examples

The following silly example defines a regression problem with the constraint that the mean and the median of the decision variable are equal. As usual, we add explicit bound constraints to improve the [big-M](/tutorial/bigmandconvexhulls) reformulations.

````matlab
A = randn(20,5);
b = randn(20,1)*20;
x = sdpvar(5,1);

e = b-A*x;
F = [mean(x) == median(x), -100 <= x <= 100];
optimize(F,norm(e,1));
````


### Comments

Since [median] is implemented using a [big-M](/tutorial/bigmandconvexhulls) approach, it is crucial that all involved variables have explicit bound constraints.

[median] builds on the [sort](/command/sort) operator which is extremely expensive. Sorting a variable of with \\(n\\) elements requires \\(n^2\\) binary variables. A more efficient integer model can be developed, make a feature request if your need this.
