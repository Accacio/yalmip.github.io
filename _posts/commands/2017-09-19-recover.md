[recover](/command/recover) creates an [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) variable based on variable indicies

### Syntax

````matlab
x = recover(index)
````

### Examples

[sdpvar](/commad/sdpvar) expressions are internally represented by variable indicies (i.e., the only internal name is a number, see  [getvariables](/command/getvariables) ). An [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) variable can manually be recovered from an index

````matlab
yalmip('clear')
x = sdpvar(1);
y = 5*x;
index = getvariables(y);
y - 5*recover(index)
ans =

     0
````

[recover](/command/recover) in combination with [depends](/command/depends) can for example conveniently be used to create a vector with all variables involved in a constraint

````matlab
sdpvar x y z
Model = [x*y <= 1, z >= 0];
Used = recover(depends(Model));
````
