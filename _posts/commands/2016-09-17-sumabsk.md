[sumabsk](/command/sumabsk) implements an operator which returns the k largest absolute values of a vector, or sum of k largest absolute eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix.

### Syntax

````matlab
y = sumk(x,k)
````

### Operator implementation

Linear programming based [graph model](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) vector case, and semidefinite programming based [graph model](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs)  for matrix case.
