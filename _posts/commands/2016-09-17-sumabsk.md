[sumabsk](/command/sumabsk) implements an operator which returns the sum of the k largest absolute values of a vector, or sum of k largest absolute eigenvalues of a positive semi-definite matrix. A weighted sum is also possible, with a non-increasing non-negative weight vector p.

### Syntax

````matlab
y = sumabsk(x,k)
y = sumabsk(x,k,p)
````

### Operator implementation

The operator is implemented using a [graph model](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) for the vector case, and semidefinite programming based [graph model](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs)  for the symmetric matrix case.
