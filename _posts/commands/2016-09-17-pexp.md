[pexp](/command/exp) models perspective exponential \\( xe^{y/x} \\)
### Syntax

````matlab
f = pexp(y,x);
f = pexp([x;y]);
````

### Comments

Note that the perspective exponential automatically is detected in simple cases.

Perspective exponential is implemented as a convexity aware [callback operators](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback), except when [SCS](/solver/scs) or [ECOS](/solver/ecos) are used and the exponential cone description is exploited in a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs).
