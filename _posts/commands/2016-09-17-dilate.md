[dilate](/command/dilate) is used to derive affine dilations for polynomially parametrized uncertain SDPs. The dilated constraint can then be used for conservatively solving robust SDPs with polytopic uncertainty.

## Syntax

````matlab
Fdilated = dilate(F,w)
[G,H,M] = dilate(X,w)
````

## Examples

The [robust SDP framework](/tutorial/robustoptimization) in YALMIP allows SDP constraints with affine dependence on the uncertainty, and a polynomial or possibly conic uncertainty description. However, it is not uncommon that the dependence with respect to the uncertainty is polynomial.

A recent approach to address this is [matrix dilations](http://www.keisu.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Research/METR/2006/METR06-10.pdf), where the polynomial dependence is reduced to an affine dependence, at the cost of a larger SDP and possible conservatism. Note that the implementation in YALMIP uses a slightly [alternative approach](http://www.control.isy.liu.se/publications/doc?id=1879).

Consider the problem of finding an upper bound on a polynomial **f** in the range 0 to 1 (this example is taken from the reference above)

````matlab
sdpvar t1 t2
f = -375*t1^4 + 800*t1^3-570*t1^2+144*t1-375*t2^4 + 800*t2^3-570*t2^2+144*t2
````

This can be formulated as a robustness problem; find the smallest possible **x** such that **x-f** is positive on the region of interest.

The expression **x-f** is not affine in the uncertainty **t1** and **t2**, hence the standard robust framework in YALMIP is not applicable. To get a robustness problem with affine dependence, we dilate the constraint

````matlab
sdpvar x
Fdilated = dilate(x-f>=0,[t1 t2])
````

The dilated constraint is affine in the uncertainty, and we can apply standard robust programming.

````matlab
F = [Fdilated, uncertain([t1 t2]), 0 <= [t1 t2] <= 1];
optimize(F,x)
````

The command can alternatively be called with an [sdpvar](/command/sdpvar) object instead of aconstraint. The output arguments are then the matrices used in the dilation. The code above is equivalent to the following

````matlab
[G,H,M] = dilate(x-f,[t1 t2])
W = sdpvar(size(G,1),size(H,2))
F = [G + W*H' + H*W' >= 0, uncertain([t1 t2]), 0 <= [t1 t2] <= 1]
optimize(F,x)
````
