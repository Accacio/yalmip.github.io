[geomean] is a convexity aware operator for geometric mean

### Syntax

````matlab
y = geomean(x)
````

### Comments

The concave operator [geomean] behaves like the built-in **geomean** command, with the addition that [geomean] applied to an Hermitian matrix returns the geometric mean of the eigenvalues.

### Operator implementation

[geomean] is implemented using a [graph representation] based on SOCP and SDP reformulations, and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity and conic representations.
