[integer]  is used to constrain a variable to be integer.

### Syntax

````matlab
F = integer(x)
````


### Examples

Setting up a integer linear program can be done as

````matlab
x = intvar(n,1);
optimize([A*x<=b],c'*x)
````

or

````matlab
x = sdpvar(n,1);
optimize([A*x<=b, integer(x)],c'*x)
````

The integrality constraint is imposed on the involved variables, not the actual expression. Hence, the following two constraints are equivalent.

````matlab
F = integer(x);
F = integer(pi+sqrt(2)*x);
````

### Comments
If possible, use [intvar](/command/intvar) instead as there are some parts in YALMIP where it can exploit integrality on an earlier stage if the varaibles have been defined as such.
