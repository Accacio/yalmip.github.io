[rank] is used for defining rank constraints.

### Syntax

````matlab
r = rank(x)
````

### Examples

The nonlinear operator [rank] is used to add rank constraints in SDP problems.
````matlabb
F = [F, rank(X)<=1];
````


### Comments
The variable returned from the [rank] operator can currently only be used for bounding ranks from above on symmetric variables, and is only supported by the solver [Solvers.LMIRANK| LMIrank].
