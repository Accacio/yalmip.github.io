[rank](/command/rank) is used for defining rank constraints.

### Syntax

````matlab
r = rank(x)
````

### Examples

The nonlinear operator [rank](/command/rank) is used to add rank constraints in SDP problems.

````matlab
F = [F, rank(X)<=1];
````


### Comments

The variable returned from the [rank](/command/rank) operator can currently only be used for bounding ranks from above on symmetric variables, and is only supported by the solver [LMIRANK](/solver/lmirank). See the [tutorial on rank constrained SDPs](/tutorial/ranksdp)
