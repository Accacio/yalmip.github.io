[pnorm](/command/pnorm) is used to create a conic model of p-norm. For standard norms 1,2 and inf the standard [norm](/command/norm) should be used.

### Syntax

````matlab
y = pnorm(x,q/r);
y = pnorm(x,p,'power')
````

### Example

Plot a TV-screen!

````matlab
x = sdpvar(2,1);
plot(pnorm(x,7/2) <= 1);
````

### Comment

The operator is implemented using a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) based on conic models, and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity in a conic form. By default it uses a second-order cone model (which can grow very large if q and r are large), but by appending a third argument this can be switched to a power cone representation which will be more compact.
