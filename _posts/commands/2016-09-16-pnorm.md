[pnorm] is used to create a conic model of rational p-norm.

### Syntax

````matlab
y = pnorm(x,q/r);
````

### Example

Plot a TV-screen!

````matlab
x = sdpvar(2,1);
plot(pnorm(x,7/2) <= 1);
````

### Comment

The convexity aware [pnorm] is implemented using a [graph representation] based on a second-order cone models, and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity in a conic form.
