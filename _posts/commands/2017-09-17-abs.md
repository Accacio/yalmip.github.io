### Syntax

````matlab
y = abs(x)
````

### Operator implementation

Absolute value [abs] has support for both convex models where [Tutorials.GraphRepresentations| graph representations] are used, and nonconvex scenarios where [Tutorials.MixedIntegerRepresentations mixed-integer representations are required].

For complex-valued arguments, [norm](X) is returned.
