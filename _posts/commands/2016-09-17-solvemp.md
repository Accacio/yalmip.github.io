[solvemp](/command/solvemp) is used for solving multiparametric problems.

## Syntax

````matlab
 [mptsol,diagnostic,u,J,U] = solvemp(Constraints,Objective,Options,Parameters)
````

## Examples

[solvemp](/command/solvemp) is used in the same way as [optimize](/command/optimize), the only difference being the fourth additional argument to define the parametric variables. See the numerous [multiparametric tutorial](/tutorial/multiparametricprogramming) for details.
