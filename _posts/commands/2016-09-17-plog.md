[plog](/command/plog) models perspective logarithm \\( x\log(y/x) \\)
### Syntax

````matlab
f = plog(y,x);
f = x*log(y/x);
````

### Comments

Note that the perspective logarithm automatically is detected in simple cases.

Perspective logarithm is implemented as a convexity aware [callback operators](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback), except when [Mosek 9](/solver/mosek), [SCS](/solver/scs) or [ECOS](/solver/ecos) are used and the exponential cone description is exploited in a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs).
