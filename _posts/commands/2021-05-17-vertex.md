[vertex](/command/vertex) computes the vertices of a polytopic constraint.

## Syntax

````matlab
V = vertex(Constraint,[x])
````

## Example
The typical use is as follows

````matlab
x = sdpvar(2,1);
B = [-1 <= x <= 1, sum(x) <= 3/2];
plot(B);hold on
v = vertex(B);
plot(v(1,:),v(2,:),'k*')
````

Models often live in a higher-dimensional space than expected due to internal modelling. For instance, the following polytope in 3D is represented in a 6D space in order to represent the absolute values. To find the vertices of the polytope in our original space, we give a second argument to explain that we only want the vertices projected onto our original space.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(3,1);
P = [-1 <= x <= 1, sum(abs(x)) <= 1]
plot(P,x);hold on
v = vertex(P,x);
plot3(v(1,:),v(2,:),v(3,:),'y*');
````

Note that all projected vertices are returned, not just the convex hull in the projected dimension.


## Comments

Very rudimentary implementation only intended for illustration and academic examples.
