[vertex](/command/vertex) computes the vertices of a polytopic constraint.

### Syntax

````matlab
V = vertex(Constraint)
````

### Example
The typical use is as follows

````matlab
x = sdpvar(2,1);
B = [-1 <= x <= 1, sum(x) <= 3/2];
plot(B);hold on
v = vertex(B);
plot(v(1,:),v(2,:),'k*')
````


### Comments

Very rudimentary implementation only intended for illustration and academic examples.
