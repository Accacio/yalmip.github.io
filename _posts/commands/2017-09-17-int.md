[int]  integrates a polynomial expression

### Syntax

````matlab
F = int(f,x,from,to)
````

### Examples

With only 1 argument, integration is performed with respect to all involved variables (no constant added)

````matlab
sdpvar x1 x2
p = 4*x1^4 + x1*x2;
sdisplay(int(p))
0.2500*x1^2*x2^2+0.8000*x1^5*x2
````

Giving a second argument controls which variables to integrate.

````matlab
sdisplay(int(p,x2))
````

Integration over an interval, with possibly symbolic limits, is done by supplying a third and fourth argument.

````matlab
sdpvar T
sdisplay(int(p,[x1 x2],[0 0],[1 T]))
0.8000*T+0.2500*T^2
````

Indefinite integration is obtained by supplying no limts as above. For a mixture of indefinite and intervals, set the upper limit to the variable it self

````matlab
sdpvar T
sdisplay(int(p,[x1 x2],[0 0],[1 x2]))
0.8000*x2+0.2500*x2^2
````
