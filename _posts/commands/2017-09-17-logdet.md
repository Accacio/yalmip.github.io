[logdet] is used to define objective functions in [determinant maximization problems](/tutorial/determinantmaximization).


### Syntax

````matlab
p = logdet(x)
````

### Comments

This command is for specifying an objective function in combination with, primarily, [SDPT3]. If you use any other SDP solver, use the [geomean] operator instead to work with the product of the eigenvalues (and thus the determinant). Note that the operator is concave and thus only can be maximized (or minimized if negated).

YALMIP will automatically replace the [logdet] term in an objective with a [geomean] when you use an SDP solver other than [SDPT3], and the objective only contains the negated [logdet] term. This is valid since the two functions are monotonically related.

If you have a [logdet] operator on a variable \\(X\\), the constraint \\(X \succeq 0\\) should not be added to the model. It is automatically assumed by the solver.
