### Syntax

````matlab
y = max(x)
y = max(x,z)
y = max(x,[],dim)
[y,loc] = max(x,[],dim)
````

### Operator implementation

The convex operator [max](/command/max) has support for both convex models where a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) can be used, and nonconvex scenarios where an [integer representation] is required.

If the location index **loc** is requested, an integer model will always be required.
