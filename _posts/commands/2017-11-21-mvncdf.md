[mvncdf](/command/mvncdf) is the [cumulative distribution function for multivariate normal variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Cumulative_distribution_function).

### Syntax
````matlab
p = mvncdf(x)
````

### Comments

The operator  is implemented as a [callback operator](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback). No derivatives are currently supplied for th multivariate case, which means the nonlinear solver then estimate these using finite differences.
