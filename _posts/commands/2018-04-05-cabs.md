[cabs](/command/cabs) overloads absolute value using a [nonlinear callback representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback).

### Syntax

````matlab
y = cabs(x)
````

### Comments

The operator is used when you do not want the absolute value to be represented using an epigraph (in the convex case) or a MILP representation (in the nonconvex case) which you get if you use [abs](/command/abs). Hence, a typical use is in a nonconvex case with a general nonlinear solver which does not have mixed-integer capabilities.
