[iff](/command/iff) is used to create equivalence constraints between logic cases

### Syntax

````matlab
F = iff(A,B)
````

### Examples

[iff](/command/iff) is used to define logic equivalence. As an example, the following code will ensure that a variable **x** satisfies a set of inequalities if and only if a binary variable **d** is true (value 1), and vice versa.

````matlab
d = binvar(1);
F = iff(d,A*x <= b);
````

[iff](/command/iff) is mainly intended for (BINARY <-> BINARY), although it can be used also for more general constructions as above (bearing in mind that these models typically are numerically sensitive and may require a lot of binary variables to be modeled).

The following code constrains a variable **y** if and only if a set of constraints on **x** hold.
````matlabb
F = iff(A*x <= b, A*y <=y);
````

The following code is equivalent
````matlabb
d = binvar(1,1);
F = iff(A*x <= b, d);
F = iff(A*y <= b, d);
````

[iff](/command/iff) is overloaded as == on constraints, hence the following code gives the same model.

````matlab
F = [(A*x <= b) == (A*y <= b)];
````

and so does the following model

````matlab
binvar d
F = [d == (A*x <= b), d == (A*y <= b)];
````

For more examples, see the [logic programming tutorial](/tutorial/logicprogramming).

### Comments
Since [iff](/command/iff) is implemented using a [tutorials.Big-M big-M] approach, it is crucial that all involved variables have explicit bound constraints.

[iff](/command/iff) is very sensitive to modelling choices (is \\(10^{-5}\\) really a positive number in practice?), so it should be avoided as much as possible. If you can rewrite your model to simple (BINARY-> Linear) using [implies](/command/implies), do so!
