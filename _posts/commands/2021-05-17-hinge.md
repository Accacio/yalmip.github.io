[hinge](/command/hinge) implements the  generalized hinge function \\( \max(0,x)^p\\) where \\( p \geq 1\\).
### Syntax

````matlab
y = hinge(x,p)
````

### Comments

The operator is implemented using a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) based on [SOCP](/tags#second-order-cone-programming) and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity and use a conic model.
