Overloads [norm] using [graph representation] or [integer reprsentation]

### Syntax

````matlab
y = norm(x)
y = norm(x,1)
y = norm(x,2)
y = norm(x,inf)
y = norm(x,'fro')
y = norm(x,'nuclear')
y = norm(x,fractional_number)
````

### Operator implementation

The convex operator [norm] is implemented using a [graph representation] based on a linear, second-order cone, or semidefinite programming model, depending on the choice of norm (second argument), and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity. For fractional norms, [pnorm] is automatically used.

Structured nonconvex scenarios are only supported for norms with second argument **1** and **'inf'** (leading to an [integer representation]). For other cases, use general nonlinear constructs with [sqrtm] and powers etc to define the expression.
