[assign] is used to explicitly assigning the value obtained when applying the command [double] on an [sdpvar] object. These values can for example be used as initial guesses when solvers support these.

Note, assign does not [replace replace] or constrain the variable with a particular value. It is only used for initial values in nonlinear solvers. Hence, only used when the option **usex0** in [sdpsettings] is activated.

### Syntax

````matlab
assign(X,Y)
````

### Examples

Variables are initialized as NaN

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,1);
value(x)

ans =
    NaN
````

By using assign, the current value can be altered

````matlab
assign(x,1)
value(x)

ans =
    1
````

By default, inconsistent assignments generate an error message.

````matlab
t = sdpvar(1,1);x = [t t];
assign(x,[1 2])
??? Error using ==> sdpvar/assign
Inconsistent assignment
````

With a third argument, a least squares assignment is obtained

````matlab
t = sdpvar(1,1);x = [t t];
assign(x,[1 2],1)
value(x)

ans =

    1.5000    1.5000
````

The value can be used as an initial guess for solvers supporting this

````matlab
x = sdpvar(1,1);
assign(x,pi);
optimize([sin(x)^2 <= .1],x,sdpsettings('usex0',1));
````
