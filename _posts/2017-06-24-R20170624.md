[Download latest release](/download)

The previous release accidentally turned off the defensive coding around the known seg-faulting bug in [CPLEX](/cplexcrash). This version activates this protection again.

### Fixes

* Limited support for options in [CPLEX](/solver/cplex) to avoid crash in recent MATLAB versions.
