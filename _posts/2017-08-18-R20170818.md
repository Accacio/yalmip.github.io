Improvements in the global solver [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb), better symbolic displays in [sdisplay](/command/sdisplay) and convenient modeling extensions in [interp1](/command/interp1)

### Fixes

* [sdisplay](/command/sdisplay) now almost works as expected, and supports rounding in display
* Extended [interp1](/command/interp1) to support generation of epi- and hypo-graph based linear programming approximants
* Fix for wrong diagnostic code when [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb) terminates due to time limit
* Improved performance when [KNITRO](/solver/knitro) is used in [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb) on problems with integer variables
* [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb) can now handle partially given initial guesses (tries to complete the rest by solving a linear feasbility problem)
* Converts to full data in [FMINCON](/solver/fmincon) for some algorithmic choices to avoid warnings about sparse data
