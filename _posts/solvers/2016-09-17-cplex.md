[cplex is not stable in recent versions of MATLAB](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/forums/html/topic?id=79772c01-f545-44ef-9543-257197f1d9e7&ps=25), and users are adviced to use alternatives such as [Gurobi](solvers/gurobi) or [Mosek](solvers/mosek) until they fix their code. Simply speaking, their options generator crashes randomly, and for that reason YALMIP can only use a limited set of the available options structure in recent MATLAB versions.
