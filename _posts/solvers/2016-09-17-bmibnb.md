BMIBNB is an implementation of a standard branch & bound algorithm for nonconvex problems, based on [(most often) linear programming relaxations and convex envelope approximations](/tutorial/envelopesinbmibnb). The [tutorial about global optimization](tutorial/globaloptimization) focus on applications of the solver.

The solver relies on external linear, quadratic and semidefinite programming solvers for solving the lower bounding relaxation problems, and nonlinear solvers for the upper bound computations.

Most important options (-1 means adaptive choice, 0 is off and 1 on)
