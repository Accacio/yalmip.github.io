KKTQP is an experimental implementation with little testing performed. It is based on solving the mixed integer linear program arising from the KKT conditions of the quadratic problem, using fast external [mixed-integer linear programming solvers](/tags#mixed-integer-linear-programming-solver)

See [nonconvex QP discussion and comparison](/example/nonconvexquadraticprogramming)
