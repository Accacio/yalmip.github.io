Built-in mixed-integer solver for convex problems.

### YALMIP
BNB is invoked using `sdpsettings('solver','bnb')`.

Available options : see `help bnb` in MATLAB

### Comments
BNB is a quick and dirty implementation of a standard branch & bound algorithm for mixed integer linear/quadratic/second order cone, semidefinite, geometric and convex nonlinear programming. However, if you have a MILP, MIQP or MISOCP, you should install a real solver such as [CPLEX], [GUROBI] or [MOSEK], since [BNB] is horribly slow compared to a dedicated implementation.

The solver relies on external solvers for solving the node problems.
