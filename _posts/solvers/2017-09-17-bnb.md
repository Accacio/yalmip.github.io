BNB is a quick and dirty implementation of a standard branch & bound algorithm for mixed integer linear/quadratic/second order, semidefinite and exponential cones, geometric and convex nonlinear programming. However, if you have a MILP, MIQP or MISOCP, you should install a real solver such as [CPLEX], [GUROBI] or [MOSEK], since [BNB] is horribly slow compared to a dedicated implementation.

The solver relies on external solvers for solving the node problems.
