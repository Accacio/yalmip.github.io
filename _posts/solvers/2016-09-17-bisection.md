The solver relies on external solvers for solving the bounding problems during the bisection phase.

Note that the solver assumes you know what you are doing and actually have a problem which is quasi-convex in some variables \\(x\\) and a scalar \\(t\\), and that your objective is \\(t\\) or \\(-t\\)
