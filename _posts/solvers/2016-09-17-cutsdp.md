CUTSDP is a solver for mixed-integer second-order cone and (primarily) semidefinite programs, implementing a cutting plane (outer approximation) approach. In contrast to the other internal mixed-integer programming solver [BNB](/solver/bnb) which relaxes the integer variables in the problem and proceeds by branch-and-bound, solving conic programs problem in every node, CUTSDP relaxes the conic constraints to linear constraints, solves a mixed-integer linear program, and adds violating linear cuts to the model and repeats.

The solver relies on a fast external [mixed-integer linear programming solver](/tags/#mixed-integer-linear-programming-solver).

An indepth description can be found in [CUTSDP explained](/The-cutsdp-solver).
