### Writing a .task file

To save a file in MOSEK's internal format first save the problem to a ``.mat`` file by using the following flag when you [set up the options](/command/sdpsettings)

``ops = sdpsettings('savedebug',1)``

and convert generated contents into the MOSEK format with

``load('mosekdebug');mosekopt('min write(dump.task.gz)', prob, param)``

If you require support from MOSEK send ``dump.task.gz`` together with other information to ``support@mosek.com``.
