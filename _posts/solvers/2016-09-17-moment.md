Built-in solver for polynomial problems.

### YALMIP

MOMENT is invoked by using `sdpsettings('solver','bmibnb')`

An alternative is to work directly with the semidefinite programming relaxation solver via [solvemoment](/commands/solvemoment)

### Comments

The solver relies on external solvers for solving the semidefinite relaxation.
