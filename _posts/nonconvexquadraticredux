Almost 10 years ago, [a post was published](example/nonconvexquadraticprogramming/), comparing a semidefinite relaxation strategy with simply using YALMIPs built-in global solvers. Although the main message of the post remains valid, the computational results are perhaps a bit outdated.

THh numbers should to be updated due to 3 main reasons

1. We now have [MOSEK](/solver/mosek) available for solving semidefinite programs more efficiently.
2. The built-in global solver [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb) has been improved.
3. There are now several easily accesible solvers for global nonconvex quadratic programming.

Hence, without further ado, we run the example again, but this time with many more solvers, and on larger problems. 

````matlab
Q = magic(5);
x = sdpvar(5,1);
optimize([-1 <= x <= 1],x'*Q*x)
