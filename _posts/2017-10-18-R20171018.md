### Fixes

* A severe bug was introduced in the previous release which caused constraints to disappear in some scenarios for large problems
* Fixed nameclash on [crossentropy](/command/crossentropy) command with the Neural Network toolbox
* [max](/command/max) involving **-inf** in all elements now behaves as expected
* Minor improvement of bound propagation for [big-M](/tutorial/bigmandconvexhulls) models involving quadratics
