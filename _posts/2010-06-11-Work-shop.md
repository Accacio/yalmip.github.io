Material from the mini-course on *YALMIP and MPT for Optimization and Modelling in Control* at the Swedish control meeting is now available for [minicourse_updated.zip]. Please note that you need the latest release to run some of the examples.

Note: The code is slightly outdated as it uses the command [solvesdp] instead of [optimize], and [double] instead of [value].
