Ouch, over a year since last release. Definitely overdue.

### Major changes, fixes and improvements

* Performance improvements in nonlinear manipulations supplied by Ingmar Gundlach and performance improvements in variable indexing by J.D. Bancal. 
* [buncertain](/commands/uncertain) is now overloaded on constraints for easy definition of uncertain variables and constraints at the same time.
* [bisection](/commands/bisection) can now be used as a solver, i.e., called via [optimize](/command/tutorial).
* Early experimental support for multi-parametric solver [POP](/solver/pop).
* Added [momentmodel](/command/momentmodel) to create moment relaxation without solving it. 
* [sort](/command/sort) now supports matrix argument.
* [max](/command/max) and [min](/command/min) now support location output in their [mixed-integer versions](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsmixedinteger).
* [interp1](/command/interp1) overloaded as a [callback operator](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback).
* Rotated second-order cones detected from model.
* **Breaking:** [bisection](/commands/bisection) now assumes minimization (to be consistent with all other commands).
