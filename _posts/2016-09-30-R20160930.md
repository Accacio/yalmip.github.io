### Major changes, fixes and improvements

* [optimizer](/command/optimizer) revised and extended significantly. See the [post on core changes](/optimizerupdates) and its experimental use for [optimization over randomized uncertainty](/example/scenariosampling).
* [optimizer](/command/optimizer) objects can now [plot](/command/plot) their feasible set.
* Added a work-around for [CPLEX](/solver/cplex) and MATLAB 2016 (causes seg-faults when defining complete options structures in [sdpsettings](/command/sdpsettings). Note that the [CPLEX](/solver/cplex) options structure will be limited with this fix, but it is the only possible work-around at the moment (besides changing solver or downgrading MATLAB to an earlier version).
* Fixed bug which caused [knitro](/solver/knitro) to crash if YALMIP could not deliver derivatives.
* Overloaded [interp2](/command/interp2).
* Added **'milp'** method in [interp1](/command/interp1) to generate [sos2](/command/sos2) model.
* Added support for options structures in [POP](/solver/pop). Note that this requires a fresh version of [POP](/solver/pop).
* Added support for the ADMM-based SDP solver [cdcs](/solver/cdcs) (with [Giovanni Fantuzzi](https://github.com/giofantuzzi)).
