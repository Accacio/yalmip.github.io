[Download latest release](/download)

Believe it or not, I do run tests before shipping...

### Fixes

* Fix for crashing [IPOPT](/solver/ipopt) (bug introduced in last release)
* Fix for failed options in [CPLEX](/solver/cplex) in pre-2016 MATLAB versions (bug introduced in last release)
* [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb) behaved strangely on problems with binary variables if [MOSEK](/solver/mosek) was used as lower solver
* Improved robustness of [envelope approximator](/tutorial/envelopesinbmibnb/) for functions with infinite gradients in [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb)
* Fixed bug in [sign](/command/sign) (operator could never take value 0)
