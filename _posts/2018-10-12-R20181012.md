This release adds some features and fixes some minor issues

### Main fixes and additions

* Display of expressions and constraints now include information about coefficient range (good for finding causes of nasty numerics)
* Improved display in [bisection](/solver/bisection) to see initial search for lower and upper bounds
* [Sparsity structures in optimizer parameterizations](/sparseoptimizer) can now be exploited to reduce overhead even further
* [optimizer](/command/optimizer) now works with [sos2](/command/sos2) models* 
* [Exponential cones](/tutorial/exponentialcone) now (partially) supported in Mosek 9 (if you are lucky enough to have their pre-release)
