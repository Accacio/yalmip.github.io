If I had a million dollars for every time I've had to explain this, I would definitely not write this post. 

Trying to develop [robust optimization](/tutorial/robustoptimization) models with [uncertainty](/command/uncertain/) appearing in equality constraints is a common mistake, and the reason people do this mistake is almost always due to failure to

 - understand the difference between a **decision variable** and an **expression involving decision variables**
 
 - understand the difference between **an equality constraint ==** and an **assignment =**
  
 - underastand the difference between a **decison variable** and a **policy or decision rule**.

### Buying a horse the old way

To understand the problem, we work with the following problem.

Alice and Bob are going to the market to buy a horse. They will pay the horse by trading with sheep. They do not know the current market price **p** of a horse, all they know is that it cost somewhere between 100 and 200 sheep. Alice and Bob will bring the sheep in their trucks. Alice will bring **a** sheep in her truck, while  Bob will bring **b** sheep. They have been told by their manager that they can under no circumstances bring any sheep back to the farm, and they can leave no sheep at the market but all sheep must be used to pay for the horse, and they must pay the market price and nothing else. Alice truck can pack 200 sheep while Bob only can carry 120 sheep.

To figure out how many sheep they should bring in their trucks when going to the market, they must thus solve the uncertain feasibility problem

$$
0 \leq a \leq  200, 0 \leq b \leq 120,  a + b = p~\forall~100 \leq p \leq 200
$$

The corresponding YALMIP model would be

````matlab
sdpvar a b p
Model = [0 <= a <= 200, 0 <= b <= 120, a + b == p, 100 <= p <= 200, uncertain(p)]
````

It should be pretty obvious that this is a nonsense problem. It is completely impossible to select the fixed decisions **a** and **b** at the farm, go the market and figure out the price, and magically have the correct number. Indeed, if you try to solve the optimization problem, it will be infeasible.

Let us untangle what has gone wrong. The first issue is that the setup simply doesn't make sense in real-life, which translates to the incorrect use of an equality ==. So what could the manager have meant that they should do, and how does that translate to the model.

It could be that the manager meant that Alice first should load her truck with **a** sheep (make a fixed decision), go to the market and check the price, and then call Bob and have him bring the remaining sheep. This is a causal structure where Bobs decision **b** really isn't a decision, but a simple function of Alice decision and the uncertainty, **b = p-d**. An **incorrect** model of this would be

````matlab
sdpvar a b p
Model = [0 <= a <= 200, 0 <= b <= 120, b == p -a, 100 <= p <= 200, uncertain(p)]
````

The problem with this model is that we are still saying that Bobs load is a fixed decision (since it is its own decision variable), while we really only want it to be a function of Alice load and the market price. We thus do not want to model an equality between two independent decision variables and an uncertain price, but simply define the linear map that arise due to the causal (time-dependent order) structure in the problem. The correct model would thus be

````matlab
sdpvar a p
b = p-a
Model = [0 <= a <= 200, 0 <= b <= 120, 100 <= p <= 200, uncertain(p)]
````
In this model there is only 1 decision variable (**a**). Bobs load is simply an assignment from fixed decisions and uncertainties. We've introduced an intermediate placeholder for our convenience, and what YALMIP sees here is really

````matlab
sdpvar a p
Model = [0 <= a <= 200, 0 <=  p-a <= 120, 100 <= p <= 200, uncertain(p)]
````

Another version could be that the manager meant that Alice and Bob actually should pick up the phone and ask what the price is, and then act accordingly. Once again, that simply means we want to define a fixed map from the price to the loads, and we no longer have any decision variables at all. One such decision rule, or policy, is that they always use \\(a = \frac{p}{2}\\) and \\(b = \frac{p}{2}\\). In other words, our model would be

````matlab
sdpvar p
a = p/2
b = p/2
Model = [0 <= a <= 200, 0 <= b <= 120, 100 <= p <= 200, uncertain(p)]
````

This model is a bit too simple (we have no decision variables!) but it illustrates the idea of a policy compared to a decision. An improvement which could be useful in a more complex scenario is to parameterize the policy. The manager thinks Alice and Bob are too dumb to load cleverly once they know the price (Alice truck is bigger so perhaps they should load more Sheep in her trcuk). Hence, he wants to create a function that they can use to select the number of cheap to load. One such policy is a linear decision rule \\(a = t_0 + t_1p, b = s_0 + s_1p\\). As long as \\(t_0+s_0 = 0\\) and \\(t_1+s_1 = 1\\), they will bring the correct amount. Here, we thus decide upon the decision rule parameters before knowing the price of the horse, but once the price is known, we have a method to distribute the load.

````matlab
sdpvar p t0 t1 s0 s1
a = t0 + t1*p;
b = s0 + s1*p;
Model = [0 <= a <= 200, 0 <= b <= 120, t0+s0 == 0, t1+s1 == 1, 100 <= p <= 200, uncertain(p)]
````

We explictly derived the condition necessary on the policy parameters for it to be correct. This can be done automatically by exploiting the fact that an equality involving uncertainties make no sense. The following model will work equivalently

````matlab
sdpvar p t0 t1 s0 s1
a = t0 + t1*p;
b = s0 + s1*p;
Model = [0 <= a <= 200, 0 <= b <= 120, a + b == p, 100 <= p <= 200, uncertain(p)]
````

So how can this work, since we've just learned that you cannot have uncertainties in equalities? When YALMIP finds the equality involving the uncertainty, it will derive the conditions required for the equality to be reasonable, i.e., it will derive the conditions necessary for the decision variables in order to completely eliminate any uncertainty in the equality. In this case, it will see the equality \\(t_0 + s_0 + (t_1 + s_1)p = p\\), and thus the only was this can be feasible for uncertain \\(p\\) is that \\(t_1+s_1=0\\), and the remaining term in the equality then says \\(t_0 + s_0 = 0\\).


### A warehouse logistics problem

In this second example, we address precisely the same mistakes and correct them in the same way. 

Alice manages a warehouse selling goods. The stock of goods available in the warehouse on the morning of day \\(i\\) is \\(w_i\\). Everyday, we sell \\(s_i\\) items but this quantity is fluctuating so all we know a-priori is that \\(200 \leq s_i \leq 1000\\). We also get delivery of supplies everyday. The delivery is not instant but arrives in the morning two days after we made the order (order made in the evening of day \\(i\\) arrives in morning of day \\(i+2\\)). We call the order made \\(u_i\\). Some customers are not happy with the product, so 10% of all sold items are returned two days after it was sold. Collecting all information, we have the dynamical system 

$$
w_i = w_{i-1} - s_{i-1} + u_{i-2} + 0.1s{i-2}
$$

The warehouse can only stock 2000 items, and we must always have enough in stock to be able to sell to all prospective customers. At the same time, keeping a large stock is a waste of capital resources, so it should be kept as small as possible. To model that, our goal it to minimize the predicted sum of the stock over the coming days.
{: .notice--success}

Let us start by setting up a typical incorrect model. We assume we are making plans for our restocking for 10 days ahead, and we assume we start from scratch in a situation where we have 1200 items in the inventory (typically you would have some history of sales and restocking orders that you would have to include). To make it even more realistic, we write the code in an ugly non-vectorized fashion, and we will also write the dynamical update in a way that hides the simple causal structure.

````matlab
sdpvar w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 w10
sdpvar u1 u2 u3 u4 u5 u6 u7 u8 u9 u10
sdpvar s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9 s10
sdpvar cost

Model = [uncertain([s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9]),
         200 <= [s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6 s7 s8 s9] <= 1000,
         w1 == 1200
         w2 + s1 == w1
         w3 + s2 == w2 + u1 + 0.1*s1
         w4 + s3 == w3 + u2 + 0.1*s2
         w5 + s4 == w4 + u3 + 0.1*s3
         w6 + s5 == w5 + u4 + 0.1*s4
         w7 + s6 == w6 + u5 + 0.1*s5
         w8 + s7 == w7 + u6 + 0.1*s6
         w9 + s8 == w8 + u7 + 0.1*s7
        w10 + s9 == w9 + u8 + 0.1*s8]
Cost = w1+w2+w3+w4+w5+w6+w7+w8+w9+w10
