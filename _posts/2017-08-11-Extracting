In normal cases, any communication between YALMIP and the solver is uninteresting, as all we are interested in is the [diagnostic code](command/yalmiperror) available in the output from [optimize](/command/optimize) and optimal values which are asigned to our decision variables and available through [value](/command/value). There are however cases where we want to obtain all the information the solver has returned in the call, and the model we sent to the solver.

#### Extracting solver input

If we want to investigate the model that YALMIP sends to a solver, we can use either the command [export](/command/export), or call the solver and use the option 'savesolveroutput'.
