title: Does YALMIP run in Octave?

Yes, but there are not many solvers available.

Additionally, YALMIP appears to run much slower on Octave. In particular the command [sdpsettings](/command/sdpsettings) is excruciatingly slow in Octave (a factor 100) so you must define it and the re-use it in any call to [optimize](/command/optimize). Note that if you do not supply an options structure to [optimize](/command/optimize), a call will be made inside [optimize](/command/optimize) to [sdpsettings](/command/sdpsettings) to create one anyway, so do not omit it.
