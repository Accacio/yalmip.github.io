Start a new thread on the Google groups YALMIP forum, or send a mail to johanl@isy.liu.se. Type ver in MATLAB and include the result in the mail. If possible, include the code and data (as simple as possible) that generated the fault, otherwise, include at least the error message etc. The more information the better.
