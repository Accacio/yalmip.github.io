The inverse operator is not supported in the YALMIP language as it is an extremely complex operation which does not have a nice representation. Unless you can reformulate your model to completely eliminate the need for the inverse (typically [Schur complements, congruence transformations or variable changes](/badsdps)) you will have to accept that you have to convert your nasty inverse to a (slightly less) nasty alternative constraint.

## Bilinear reformulation

The standard alternative to a model involving \\(X^{-1}y\\) is to replace this expression with a new variable \\(z\\) and add the bilinear constraint \\(Xz = y\\) to your model. Note that invertability is lost in this form though (for instance \\((X=0, y=0, z=0\\) is feasible)

## MILP reformulation

A reformulation which can work if the matrix only depends on a small number of binary variables is to perform an explicit enumeration of all possible combinations. The model for \\(z = X^{-1}y\\) would then be

````matlab
% Find all involved variables (assumed binary)
involved = recover(depends(X));
n = length(involved)

% Loop through all combinatorial cases and define relationship by implication
cases = binvar(1,2^n-1);
Model = [sum(cases) == 1]
for i = 0:2^n-1
    xi = dec2decbin(i,n)';
    assign(involved,xi);
    V = value(X);
    if rank(V) == n
        Model = [Model, implies(cases(i), [z == inv(V)*y, x == xi])];
    else
        Model = [Model, cases(i) == 0];
    end
end
````

## Blackbox formulation

If you only need some scalar function which involves an inverse of a matrix which depends on some variable, you can use a [blackbox](/command) approach. The drawback is of course that you are hiding structure completely, and your arrive at a general nonlinear nonconvex nonsmooth program.

````matlab
q = [2;1];
f = @(x)(q'*inv([1 + sin(1+x(1))^2 2;2 4 + cos(x(1)-x(2))^2])*q);

x = sdpvar(2,1);
y = blackbox(f,x);

optimize([],y);
value(y)
f(value(x))
````
