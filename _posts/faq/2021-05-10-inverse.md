The inverse operator is not support in the YALMIP language for the simple reason that it is an extremely complex operation whih does not have a nice representation. Unless you can reformulate your model to completely eliminate the need for the inverse (typically [Schur complements, congruence transformations or variable changes](/badsdps)) you will have to accept that you have to convert your nasty inverse to a nasty bilinear equality constraint.

The only way to handle a model involving \\(X^{-1}y\\) is to replace this expression with a new variable \\(z\\) and add the bilinear constraint \\(Xz = y\\) to your model.
