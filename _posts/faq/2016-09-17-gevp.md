Three options. The first one is to code your own script based on a simple bisection. This is illustrated in the [decay-rate example](/example/decayrate). Alternatively, use the [bisection](/command/bisection) command. A final (worse) alternative is to install the BMI solvers [PENBMI](/solver/penbmi) or  [PENLAB](/solver/penlab). These solvers solve GEVP problems globally (in theory).
