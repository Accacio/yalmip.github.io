Ouch, over a year since last release. Definitely overdue.

### Major changes, fixes and improvements

* [uncertain](/command/uncertain) is now overloaded on constraints for easy definition of uncertain variables and constraints at the same time.
* [bisection](/command/bisection) can now be used as a solver, i.e., called via [optimize](/command/optimize).
* Early experimental support for multi-parametric solver [POP](/solver/pop).
* [sort](/command/sort) now supports matrix argument.
* [max](/command/max) and [min](/command/min) now support location output in their [mixed-integer versions](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsmixedinteger).
* [interp1](/command/interp1) overloaded as a [callback operator](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback).
* [Rotated second-order cones](/command/rcone) can be detected from model.
* Added [momentmodel](/command/momentmodel) to create a moment relaxation model without solving it. 
* robustify is now called [robustmodel](/command/robustmodel).
* compilesos is now called [sosmodel](/command/sosmodel). 
* Performance improvements in nonlinear manipulations supplied by Ingmar Gundlach.
* Performance improvements in variable indexing supplied by J.D. Bancal.
* **Breaking:** [bisection](/command/bisection) now assumes minimization (to be consistent with all other commands).
