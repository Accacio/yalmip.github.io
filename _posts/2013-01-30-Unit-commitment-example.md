A common application of integer programming is the unit commitment problem in power generation, i.e., scheduling of set of power plants in order to meet a current and forecasted power demand while minimizing costs.

To see how such a problem is modeled in YALMIP, a [unit commitment example](/ylmip/examples/unitcommitment) is now available.

If you would like to see how additional constraints or logic behaviour can be added to the model, let me know!

> Take-away from example: Don't multiply binary variables and continuous varaibles unless you actually have to!
