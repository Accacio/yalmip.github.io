Peole often wonder my it takes several seconds/minutes/hours/days to solve their (claimed small) mixed-integer linear program. They know that integer programming is theoretically intractable, but fail to grasp how quickly exponential complexity can slap you in the face.

Let us take a simple example with a mixed-integer linear program with "just" 1000 binary variables. Surely that should be solved relatively fast also in the worst case? Assume your solver  manages to solve 10000 LP relaxations per second. In one minute we will solve 600000 LPs, in one day 864000000 LPs, in one year 315 billion LPs, and in 13.7 billion years (the age of the universe) we will complete 4.32*10^21 LPs.

In the worst case, to solve a MILP with 1000 variables, we will have to go through all possible cases, i.e. 2^1000. How large is 2^1000 compared to 4.32*10^21? Absolutely enormous. Already 2^72 is larger than 4.32*10^21, i.e., with our solver we might, in the worst case, only solve a problem with 72 binary variables if we are given the age of the universe to finish. For a problem with 1000 variables, the required time is absolutely incomprehensible.

In practice, we are lucky when we solve MILPs. We routinely solve problems with thousands of variables, but once in a while, we will (and must) find problems which we simply cannot solve.
