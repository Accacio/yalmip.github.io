[Download latest release](/download)

A new decade so time for some patches (Third decade with a public release, but I think the first line of code was written in 1999, so it's been alive over 4 decades...)

### Main fixes and additions

* Fixes for Octave 5 (big thanks to [@teerav42](https://github.com/teerav42) Travis Arnold!)
* Updated to support CPLEX 12.10
* Improved global solver [bmibnb](/solver/bmibnb/) (in particular in finding feasible solutions and improving the upper bound)
* Unbounded domains supported in global solver [bmibnb](/solver/bmibnb/)
* Improved mixed-integer representation of nonconvex [min](/command/min) and  [max](/command/max)
* A new testing framework (more on that in separate post later)
* Very strong warnings added for users using strict inequalities
