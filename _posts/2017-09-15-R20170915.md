### Fixes

* Improved performance in compiling large poorly vectorized models involving high-level operators
* Linear programming based graph models in [interp1](/command/interp1) can now be based on either point interpolation (inner approximation), or tangent cuts (outer approximation)
* Nonconvex data in [interp1](/command/interp1) can be used to create linear programming based lower envelope representations
